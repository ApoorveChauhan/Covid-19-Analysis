# COVID-19 Global Time Series Analysis Dashboard
## 1) Project Description
The COVID-19 Global Time Series Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze the worldwide spread of COVID-19 using datasets on confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries. It highlights key metrics such as total confirmed, deaths, recovered, recovery rates and death rates while showing country-wise and global trends over time. The dashboard helps identify the most affected regions, track growth patterns and evaluate pandemic responses, making it a useful tool for policymakers, researchers and healthcare professionals to make data-driven decision.

## 2) Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to compare the impact of COVID-19 across different countries, study how quickly the virus spread and measure how recovery and fatality rates changed over time. It also aims to provide insights into patterns and anomalies that can help understand global health challenges and responses.

## 3)Tech Stack
1) 📊 Power BI Desktop :– Main data visualization platform used for analysis and reporting.
2) 📂 Power Query :– Used for cleaning, transforming and reshaping the raw data.
3) 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) :– For calculated measures like active cases, recovery rate and fatality rate.
4) 📝 Data Modeling :– Relationships created between confirmed, deaths and recovered datasets to enable cross-filtering and aggregations.
5) 📁 File Format :– .pbix for dashboard development, .xlsx for datasets, .png for dashboard previews.
6) 📁 MS-Excel :- Used for cleaning, transformation, calculations and data handling.

🔹 Features / Highlights
Business Problem

The COVID-19 pandemic affected every country, but the rate of spread, fatality, and recovery varied significantly across regions.
Raw datasets made it difficult for policymakers, researchers, and the public to quickly answer questions like:

Which countries are most affected?

How fast are cases rising in different regions?

What are the recovery and mortality rates across countries?

How has the spread evolved over time globally?

Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver an interactive analytical tool that:

Tracks confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide.

Provides country-level and global-level insights.

Highlights trends in growth rates, recovery rates, and fatality rates.

Supports public health strategies and policy decisions with data-backed insights.

🔹 Business Impact & Insights

📈 Countries like the USA, India, and Brazil recorded the highest confirmed cases globally.

⚰️ European countries initially had higher mortality rates, while Asian countries showed lower fatality rates due to early interventions.

💊 Recovery rates improved significantly over time with vaccination rollouts and improved healthcare responses.

🌍 Geographic maps showed shifting epicenters: China → Europe → USA → India.

📊 The dashboard helped identify flattening curves vs. rising curves, critical for policymakers in planning lockdowns and healthcare allocation.
