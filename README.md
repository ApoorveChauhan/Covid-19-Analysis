# COVID-19 Global Time Series Analysis Dashboard
## 1) Project Description
The COVID-19 Global Time Series Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze the worldwide spread of COVID-19 using datasets on confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries. It highlights key metrics such as total confirmed, deaths, recovered, recovery rates and death rates while showing country-wise and global trends over time. The dashboard helps identify the most affected regions, track growth patterns and evaluate pandemic responses, making it a useful tool for policymakers, researchers and healthcare professionals to make data-driven decision.

## 2) Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to compare the impact of COVID-19 across different countries, study how quickly the virus spread and measure how recovery and fatality rates changed over time. It also aims to provide insights into patterns and anomalies that can help understand global health challenges and responses.

## 3)Tech Stack
1) 📊 Power BI Desktop :– Main data visualization platform used for analysis and reporting.
2) 📂 Power Query :– Used for cleaning, transforming and reshaping the raw data.
3) 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) :– For calculated measures like active cases, recovery rate and fatality rate.
4) 📝 Data Modeling :– Relationships created between confirmed, deaths and recovered datasets to enable cross-filtering and aggregations.
5) 📁 File Format :– .pbix for dashboard development, .xlsx for datasets, .png for dashboard previews.
6) 📁 MS-Excel :- Used for cleaning, transformation, calculations and data handling.

## 5) Project Highlights
### Business Problem
The COVID-19 pandemic affected every country, but the rate of spread, fatality and recovery varied significantly across regions.
Raw datasets made it difficult for policymakers, researchers and the public to quickly answer questions like:
1) Which countries are most affected?
2) How fast are cases rising in different regions?
3) What are the recovery and mortality rates across countries?
4) How has the spread evolved over time globally?

### Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive analytical tool that:
1) Tracks confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries worldwide.
2) Provides country-level and global-level insights.
3) Highlights trends in growth rates, recovery rates and fatality rates.
4) Supports public health strategies and policy decisions with data-backed insights.

### Walkthrough of Key Visuals
#### 📌 Global Overview Dashboard
1) KPIs: Total Confirmed, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Recovery Rate and Death Rate.
2) Monthly Trends (Line Chart) – Monthly trends in confirmed, deaths and recoveries.
3) World Map (Map) – Geographic spread of conifrmed cases, deaths, recovered cases across regions
4) Death Analysis (Matrix) - Monthly deaths by country.

#### 📌 Country-wise comparison Dashboard
1) Top 5 and bottom 5 Countries by Confirmed Cases (Column Chart).
2) Top 5 and bottom 5 Countries by Deaths (Column Chart).
3) Top 5 and bottom 5 Countries by Recovered Cases (Column Chart).

### Insights Generated 
1) USA, India and Brazil were the most affected countries by COVID-19 cases, while countries like Serbia, Kiribati, and Micronesia reported the least cases.
2) India, Brazil and the USA recorded the highest number of recoveries globally, but at the same time, these countries also reported the highest number of deaths.
3) The highest peak in confirmed cases occurred in April 2021, while the lowest cases were reported in January 2020.
-Highest deaths were recorded in January 2021 and the lowest in January 2020.
-Maximum recoveries were observed in May 2021 and the lowest recoveries in January 2020.
4) European countries initially showed higher mortality rates, while Asian countries reported lower fatality rates due to faster preventive measures and interventions.
5) Recovery rates improved steadily over time, supported by vaccination drives and better healthcare systems.
6) The pandemic epicenter shifted over time — starting in China, moving to Europe, then to the USA, and later to India.
